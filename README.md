Dear Blitz Basic User,

The TeraBit DataPacker and Extraction functions have been designed to allow you to protect the media which ships with your projects
from pilfering hands! It's not crack proof (what is!?) but it will be more trouble than it's worth for most people to break into it! 
If you want to have a MODable game, then simply allow the users to create their own packs and give them some (different) keys.

The Package consists of:

* A GUI Packer, tooled to make the Packing and protection of your investment, as painless as possible. 
* A Include file 'Bones.bb' - Which contains the functions you will need to include in your project to make use of the Data.Pak etc.
* 4 Demonstration Projects which show how to use most of the functions
* A DLL required to run the GUI Packmaker on Windows 2000 & Earlier
